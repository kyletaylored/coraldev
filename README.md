# coraldev
Simple script for getting Coral environmental board set up.

## Getting started
If using a Raspberry Pi Zero, you may run into header issues when installing the `python3-coral-enviro` package. You can see more details in this [Coral Dev issue](https://github.com/f0cal/google-coral/issues/23), but can run the install script in this repo to fix the latest issues.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyletaylored/coraldev/master/install.sh | bash
```
